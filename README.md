# Nomis

Just a few details about my code. I was asked to please build a suite of 2-3 test cases for the home page at https://www.nomissolutions.com/. I used the Page Object pattern and wrote my tests in /src/test/java/page/tests/ and my Homepage Factory and utilities package are in /src/main/java/. I wrote 3 test cases,

1. Test the Search functionality with a sample word, click the search button and verify that the user is navigated to the correct search results page URL and that search results are displayed. 

2. Test the 'About' page (users may want to find out more about Nomis Solutions). Hover over the 'About Nomis' and click on 'About Nomis' link, verify that the user navigated to the correct URL and the About page information is displayed to the user.

3. Test the 'Request a Demo' link (for users that may want to request a demo). Click the Request a Demo link and verify that the user was navigated to the correct URL and the Request Demo form is properly displayed.

  The Test Report is available, view 'TestReport.html' in your browser. I can extend the tests to cover more but I wanted to show what I had so far. If you need anything else or you need me to document the Test Cases manually please let me know, and I will attend to it. Thank you for the opportunity.
